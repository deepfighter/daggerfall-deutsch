QuestorOffer:  [1000]
You are not by any chance free to
 run a little errand for me? It's
 very simple, I would do it myself
 or have one of my runners take
 care of it, but we are all so very
 busy. It would mean an extra _reward_
 gold pieces. That's not too bad.
 Are you available?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
No? %god save me from
 idle %ra hands.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
What luck. Now, take this _item_
 and go to ___qgfriend_
 to a place called __qgfriend_.
 There's an odd =qgfriend_
 there named _qgfriend_.
 Give %g2 the _item_ and %g
 will give you the _reward_ gold.
 Oh, and you need to be there in
 =queston_ days, but that should not
 be a problem. You have sturdy young
 legs. Off with you, what.

QuestFail:  [1003]
You look like %pcf,
 but you can't be.  %pcn
 is on the way to ___qgfriend_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
_questgiver_ hired you as a runner?
 Ah, the _item_ I've been expecting.
 Very good. Here's your gold. Thank you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
<--->
There's been an extraordinary increase in smuggling lately.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I heard someone came across a _item_ out in the middle of nowhere.
<--->
_questgiver_ is mad as hell at some incompetent %ra courier.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some =qgfriend_ was just here, waving around some _item_.
<--->
I guess _questgiver_ didn't steal that _item_
 after all or else %g ate it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I recognize those sturdy young legs. How are you, my old courier?
<--->
Come back to visit your old employer, have you, %pcf?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I remember you. You're the
 %ra who failed that simple
 delivery assignment.  %oth, I
 have no time for you.

Message:  1011
%g's a thoroughly respectable ruler, with kleptomanic tendencies.
<--->
A big-time jewelry smuggler, from what I hear.

Message:  1012
One of _questgiver_'s fences. _qgfriend_ practically lives at __qgfriend_.
<--->
That =qgfriend_? _qgfriend_ is a fence for a den of smugglers at __qgfriend_.

Message:  1015
%qdt: _questgiver_ of
 __questgiver_ has asked me
 to deliver a certain _item_ to
 an associate named _qgfriend_.
 _qgfriend_'s current haunt is
 __qgfriend_ in ___qgfriend_,
 a journey of about =queston_ days.
 That's how long I have, anyway.
