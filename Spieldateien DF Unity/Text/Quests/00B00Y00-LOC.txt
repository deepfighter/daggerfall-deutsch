We have but one rule at the School of Julianos -- knowledge
 is to be shared. Unfortunately, we have a former member
 of our order who has forsaken this rule and needs to be
 punished. If we offered you _reward_ gold pieces, would
 you pursue and slay this erstwhile member of our School?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Disappointing. Well, we'll find someone else doubtlessly.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
Good. The prodigal one is a
 nightblade called =monster_
 who has taken refuge in %g3 laboratory,
 ___mondung_. If you have not
 returned in =1stparton_ days with _monster_'s
 blood on your hands, we will assume you have failed or have
 joined =monster_ and your
 reward will be forfeited to someone who will not fail. I
 trust I've made myself clear. Good luck and goodbye.

While that nightblade lives, I am not interested in chatting on any subject, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
Very nice, %pcf.
 Very nice indeed. Here is your _reward_ gold
 pieces. We are very grateful to you.

I hear there's a nightblade in ___mondung_, selling spells for money.
<--->
Renegade spellcasters are very dangerous. I hope they get that _monster_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=monster_ has supposedly moved on, still selling spells for money.
<--->
I hear the School of Julianos has unleashed the Knights Mentor after someone.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They finally got that _monster_. You can't have undisciplined mages loose.
<--->
Pity about them catching that _monster_. I hear he had a lot of juicy dirt.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You're %pcn. Good job with that =monster_,
 you remember, the renegade spellcaster?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmph. You really blew that job to slay
 the renegade spellcaster =monster_, didn't you?

 The School of Julianos in ___questgiver_
 has hired me to kill a prodigal
 _monster_ of their temple,
 =monster_. I have =1stparton_ days to
 get to %g3 hideout, ___mondung_,
 and back to the School.

Message:  1031
You have slain =monster_.
 The School will be proud.
