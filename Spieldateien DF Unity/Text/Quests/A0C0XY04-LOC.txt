My name is _agent_. I
 represent a someone that needs
 to ... acquire something. Whoever
 delivers it will be rewarded
 with _artifact_. I
 don't know what that is, but I
 am told it is an item of power.
 Are you willing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
Forget you ever saw me. I have
 powerful friends. If you cause
 me any trouble, they will hunt
 you down like a rogue thief.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
You must get the daedric
 _ingredient_ from ___dungeon_.
 I don't know where that is, but
 I'm sure you can find it.
 When you have the daedric
 _ingredient_ bring it to
 _meetingplace_ here in town.
 There you will meet _qgiver_,
 and %g will give you the _artifact_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear the king is making an
 important announcement next week.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Some poor fool went into ___dungeon_.
 I hear the place is full of demons.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Stay away from _qgiver_. I
 hear %g is a liar and a cheat.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Sorry about the incident with _qgiver_.
 I suppose I ought to help you just to
 make up for it.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
That business with _qgiver_ wasn't
 my fault. I'm not about to get mixed
 up with you now, so just leave me alone.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 I met with _agent_ of ___agent_.
 %g told me that a mysterious client of
 %g3 was looking for daedric _ingredient_.
 If I can find it, I will get the _artifact_.
 The daedric _ingredient_ is somewhere
 in ___dungeon_.  When I find it, I am
 to meet a _qgiver_ at
 _meetingplace_ here in __meetingplace_.

Message:  1011
On %qdt,
 the guardian of the daedric _ingredient_
 told me that _agent_'s mysterious
 client doesn't even have the _artifact_.
 If I hand over the daedric _ingredient_,
 death will be my only reward. The guardian
 gave me a magical token that will render
 _qgiver_ helpless.

Message:  1012
I will fight you to the death to protect
 the daedric _ingredient_. You should
 know that _qgiver_ is not what %g
 seems. The _artifact_ is a long lost
 item of great power that %g has never
 owned. %g means to kill you once %g
 has possession of the daedric
 _ingredient_. Cease this futile
 attack and I will give you a magical
 token that can render _qgiver_
 helpless. If you kill %g2, I can see
 to it that the Mages Guild looks
 favorably upon you for quite some
 time. Do you accept my offer?

Message:  1013
Fool! Did you really think
 that I would give you the
 _artifact_ for this
 daedric _ingredient_? The only
 reward I have for you is
 death! See me as I really
 am and tremble in fear. I
 am =orc_. Kill him!

Message:  1014
Wha ... I have been betrayed!
 You have broken the illusion
 and cast a spell of silence
 on me. That cursed _guardian_
 =guardian_ put you up to this,
 didn't %g? To arms!  Help me!
 To arms!

Message:  1015
In your mind, you hear the
 soft whisper of an alien
 voice, "Well done,
 %pcn. Slaying
 _qgiver_, or =monster_
 as %g is known to %g3 own
 people, has earned you a
 reward. Members of the
 Mage's Guild now trust you
 far more than before."

Message:  1020
You have a truly devious
 mind. I admire that. But
 you should know that I am
 not to be trifled with.
 I take back my token and
 curse you to be mistrusted
 by my closest allies.
